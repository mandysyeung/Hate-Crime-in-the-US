# Hate-Crime-in-the-US

This Python project formed an integral part of CareerFoundry's Data Analytics course, focusing on the in-depth analysis of hate crime victim data. The objective was to explore and unveil intricate relationships between various variables such as geographical patterns, demographic groups affected by prejudice, types of offenses committed, and temporal trends spanning several years.

Through this project, I delved into geographical insights to identify regions with higher incidences of hate crimes, conducted detailed examinations into the demographic groups most vulnerable to prejudice, and analyzed the prevalence of different types of offenses over time. Using Python programming, I applied statistical techniques and data visualization tools to derive meaningful insights that shed light on the dynamics and trends within hate crime incidents.

The project not only enhanced my technical skills in data manipulation, exploratory analysis, and visualization but also deepened my understanding of the societal impact and complexities surrounding hate crimes. It provided a hands-on opportunity to apply data analytics methodologies to real-world issues, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of data-driven decision-making and insights generation in the field of data analytics.

# Key Questions

My assignment involves conducting a series of analyses using hate crime data to uncover insights into the following questions: 

1. What are the most prevalent types of hate crime?
2. Which demographic or identity groups were disproportionately affected by prejudice?
3. Which states reported the highest number of hate crimes?

These questions aim to delve into the patterns and dynamics of hate crimes across different dimensions, offering insights into the nature and distribution of such incidents over time (1991 - 2018) and across geographic locations.

# Storyboard

The outcomes of our analysis have been showcased in a Tableau storyboard. It's important to note that while the storyboard provides a comprehensive overview, it does not encompass every analytical step undertaken during the project. For a detailed exploration of the insights gained and methodologies applied, please refer to the storyboard linked below:

In the storyboard, you will find a condensed presentation of key findings and visualizations that highlight trends in hate crime data. These insights include the prevalence of different hate crime types, the demographics most affected by prejudice, and an analysis of states with the highest reported incidences of hate crimes. This visualization-driven approach aims to provide clarity and facilitate understanding of complex data patterns related to hate crimes.
